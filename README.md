About the project: 
           The purpose of this project is to give a view of an olden dayâ€™s village to the younger generation. Playing this project in the VR gives a pleasant experience of nature. Various buildings, Trees, Plants etc are used in the project to make the village more realistic. Also added a few cultivating lands where you can see various cultivations. 
Added Features:
1.	Wind:
When it comes to the environment air plays an important role in the day-to-day life. Without the air, the life of living things becomes the deadly dream. In this project I added the wind effect to tell the importance of air in our life. Also, dancing trees look beautiful than the idle trees. High speed wind will spoil the mood, so I added a slow wind to make the environment more pleasant to experience.

2.	Audio:
Life feels empty without music. Music changes our mood so to make more comfortable viewing experience I have added audio to the project. The subtle music in the project makes your presence more realistic to the environment. 
Other Features:
1.	Skybox- To provide Sky to the world
2.	Fog- To change the climate
3.	Terrain- To add mountains and trees
4.	Text- One house has text on its door

Mindset:
1.	When completing this project, I understood the power of the Unity Engine.
2.	Developing a project in unity needs more practice and we must be passionate about the creation.
3.	Spending a lot of time in improvising gives a variety of outcomes.
4.	With the Unity engine and creativity, one can create their own world and using VR they can experience their presence in it.
5.	I am going to explore more to create more fun stuff.
